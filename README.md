# NusseltNumber
This repository provides a function object and tutorial for the calculation of Nusselt number based on OpenFoam-8 libraries.


The Nusselt number is calculated for the two boundaries given as input.

Nu = Convective heat transfer / Conductive heat transfer

The nusselt number field is displayed on the cylinder boundary of the tutorial case.

# Usage

**Step 1.** Compile the functionObject in OpenFOAM-8.

$wmake

**Step 2.** To run the tutorial:

$ cd /NusseltNumber/tutorial

$ ./Allrun

**Addition.** To delete functionObject:

$ cd /NusseltNumber

$ wclean
