# NusseltNumber
This repository provides a function object and tutorial for the calculation of Nusselt number based on OpenFoam-8 libraries.


The Nusselt number is calculated for the two boundaries given as input.

Nu = Convective heat transfer / Conductive heat transfer

The results are obtained as a field and the Nusselt Number value is displayed on the calculated boundary.
